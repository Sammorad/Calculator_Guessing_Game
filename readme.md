# Calculator and Guessing Game Project
## The calculator Project

The calculator was designed to accept two numbers and can perform any of four operations at a time.  
This operations will include addition, subtraction, division and multiplication  

### Initialization and Validation 
The system is designed to validate user inputs. Such that inputs can only be integers or floats.
At instances where user wrongly inputs an operator the calculator returns an error message.  

## The Guessing Game Project

In this game, users are allowed to guess the integer input into the system.  
When the users guess is lower the game returns a warning message 
when users input a number higher, the system also returns a warning message.  
That way, users are tailored towards the number.  
### Initialization and Validation 
The user is allow to input only intergers 
And a list has been created to help validate when the user enters a number twice. 
So doing the life count of the user remains unchanged. 
Worth nothing is dt there is a maximum number of guess.  
The maximum numbers can be adjusted by the admin who has access to the code
